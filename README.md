<h3 align="center">PIRATE DEFENSE</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Defend your ship against pirates! I made this game many years ago when I was first starting out as a developer. After recovering some of the files from a corrupted drive, 
    I got it back into working condition, and now it's safe on github :)
